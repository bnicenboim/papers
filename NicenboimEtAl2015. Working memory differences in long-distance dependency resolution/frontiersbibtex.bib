  abstract =      {We present a detailed process theory of the
                   moment-by-moment working-memory retrievals and
                   associated control structure that subserve sentence
                   comprehension. The theory is derived from the
                   application of independently motivated principles of
                   memory and cognitive skill to the specialized task of
                   sentence parsing. The resulting theory construes
                   sentence processing as a series of skilled
                   associative memory retrievals modulated by
                   similarity-based interference and fluctuating
                   activation. The cognitive principles are formalized
                   in computational form in the Adaptive Control of
                   Thought-Rational (ACT-R) architecture, and our
                   process model is realized in ACT-R. We present the
                   results of 6 sets of simulations: 5 simulation sets
                   provide quantitative accounts of the effects of
                   length and structural interference on both
                   unambiguous and garden-path structures. A final
                   simulation set provides a graded taxonomy of double
                   center embeddings ranging from relatively easy to
                   extremely difficult. The explanation of
                   center-embedding difficulty is a novel one that
                   derives from the model' complete reliance on
                   discriminating retrieval cues in the absence of an
                   explicit representation of serial order information.
                   All fits were obtained with only 1 free scaling
                   parameter fixed across the simulations; all other
                   parameters were ACT-R defaults. The modeling results
                   support the hypothesis that fluctuating activation
                   and similarity-based interference are the key factors
                   shaping working memory in sentence processing. We
                   contrast the theory and empirical predictions with
                   several related accounts of sentence-processing
                   complexity.},

  abstract =      {This paper investigates the role of resource
                   allocation as a source of processing difficulty in
                   human sentence comprehension. The paper proposes a
                   simple information-theoretic characterization of
                   processing difficulty as the work incurred by
                   resource reallocation during parallel, incremental,
                   probabilistic disambiguation in sentence
                   comprehension, and demonstrates its equivalence to
                   the theory of Hale [Hale, J. (2001). A probabilistic
                   Earley parser as a psycholinguistic model. In
                   Proceedings of NAACL (Vol. 2, pp. 159-166)], in which
                   the difficulty of a word is proportional to its
                   surprisal (its negative log-probability) in the
                   context within which it appears. This proposal
                   subsumes and clarifies findings that high-constraint
                   contexts can facilitate lexical processing, and
                   connects these findings to well-known models of
                   parallel constraint-based comprehension. In addition,
                   the theory leads to a number of specific predictions
                   about the role of expectation in syntactic
                   comprehension, including the reversal of
                   locality-based difficulty patterns in syntactically
                   constrained contexts, and conditions under which
                   increased ambiguity facilitates processing. The paper
                   examines a range of established results bearing on
                   these predictions, and shows that they are largely
                   consistent with the surprisal theory.},

                   syntactic processing complexity, dependency locality
                   theory (DLT) and surprisal, against the Dundee
                   Corpus, which contains the eye-tracking record of 10
                   participants reading 51,000 words of newspaper text.
                   Our results show that DLT integration cost is not a
                   significant predictor of reading times for arbitrary
                   words in the corpus. However, DLT successfully
                   predicts reading times for nouns. We also find
                   evidence for integration cost effects at auxiliaries,
                   not predicted by DLT. For surprisal, we demonstrate
                   that an unlexicalized formulation of surprisal can
                   predict reading times for arbitrary words in the
                   corpus. Comparing DLT integration cost and surprisal,
                   we find that the two measures are uncorrelated, which
                   suggests that a complete theory will need to
                   incorporate both aspects of processing complexity. We
                   conclude that eye-tracking corpora, which provide
                   reading time data for naturally occurring,
                   contextualized sentences, can complement experimental
                   evidence as a basis for theories of processing

                   variation in comprehension ability is predicted by
                   measures of working memory capacity (WMC). The
                   primary goal of this study was to investigate the
                   mediating role of mind-wandering experiences in the
                   association between WMC and normal individual
                   differences in reading comprehension, as predicted by
                   the executive-attention theory of WMC (e.g., Engle \&
                   Kane, 2004). We used a latent-variable,
                   structural-equation-model approach, testing skilled
                   adult readers on 3 WMC span tasks, 7 varied
                   reading-comprehension tasks, and 3 attention-control
                   tasks. Mind wandering was assessed using
                   experimenter-scheduled thought probes during 4
                   different tasks (2 reading, 2 attention-control). The
                   results support the executive-attention theory of
                   WMC. Mind wandering across the 4 tasks loaded onto a
                   single latent factor, reflecting a stable individual
                   difference. Most important, mind wandering was a
                   significant mediator in the relationship between WMC
                   and reading comprehension, suggesting that the
                   WMC–comprehension correlation is driven, in part,
                   by attention control over intruding thoughts. We
                   discuss implications for theories of WMC, attention
                   control, and reading comprehension.},

                   theory of comprehension posits a linguistic
                   workingmemory functionally separated from the
                   representation of linguistic knowledge. G. S. Waters
                   and D.Caplan's (1996) critique of this approach
                   retained the notion of a separate working memory. In
                   thisarticle, the authors present an alternative
                   account motivated by a connectionist approach to
                   languagecomprehension. In their view, processing
                   capacity emerges from network architecture and
                   experienceand is not a primitive that can vary
                   independently. Individual differences in
                   comprehension do not stemfrom variations in a
                   separate working memory capacity; instead they emerge
                   from an interaction ofbiological factors and language
                   experience. This alternative is argued to provide a
                   superior account ofcomprehension results previously

  abstract =      {It is well known that sentences containing
                   object-extracted relative clauses (e.g., The reporter
                   that the senator attacked admitted the error) are
                   more difficult to comprehend than sentences
                   containing subject-extracted relative clauses (e.g.,
                   The reporter that attacked the senator admitted the
                   error). Two major accounts of this phenomenon make
                   different predictions about where, in the course of
                   incremental processing of an object relative,
                   difficulty should first appear. An account
                   emphasizing memory processes (Gibson, 1998; Grodner
                   \& Gibson, 2005) predicts difficulty at the relative
                   clause verb, while an account emphasizing
                   experience-based expectations (Hale, 2001; Levy,
                   2008) predicts earlier difficulty, at the relative
                   clause subject. Two eye movement experiments tested
                   these predictions. Regressive saccades were much more
                   likely from the subject noun phrase of an object
                   relative than from the same noun phrase occurring
                   within a subject relative (Experiment 1) or within a
                   verbal complement clause (Experiment 2). This effect
                   was further amplified when the relative pronoun that
                   was omitted. However, reading time was also inflated
                   on the object relative clause verb in both
                   experiments. These results suggest that the violation
                   of expectations and the difficulty of memory
                   retrieval both contribute to the difficulty of object
                   relative clauses, but that these two sources of
                   difficulty have qualitatively distinct behavioral
                   consequences in normal reading.},
