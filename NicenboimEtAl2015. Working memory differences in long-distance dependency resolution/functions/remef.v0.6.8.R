### function remef (REMove EFfects)
# remove random factors variance and fixed effects from the dependent variable of an LMM analysis

# by Sven Hohenstein, Reinhold Kliegl, 2011, 2012, 2013

# v0.6.8, June 2013

## VERSION HISTORY:
# changes to last version (v0.6.7, December 2012):
# - function now uses the new lme4 function for 'lmerMod' objects
#   (lme4Eigen is no longer used)
# - the plot parameter is deprecated
# - minor code changes
# v0.6.6, February 2012:
# - the argument "all" (string) for the parameter 'ran'
#   selects all random effects
# v0.6.5, February 2012:
# - the function now works with objects created by the library
#  	lme4Eigen too
# changes to last version (v0.6.2, August 2011):
# - former parameter 'link' is now called 'family'
# - family parameter is specified as object (not string),
#	like, e.g., in lmer()
# - functions are called from the correct package
# - new parameter 'plot': if TRUE, a plot of the uncorrected
# 	and corrected dependent variable is displayed
# v0.6.2 August 2011
# - a bug occuring when NULL was part of the random effects list
#   was removed
# v0.6, June 2011
# - a bug was removed
# v0.54, June 2011:
# - new parameter 'link' specifying the logit link function; either
#   "identity" or "logit"
# - redundant entries are removed from the vectors in the list 'ran'
# v0.54, June 2011:
# - Fixed effects (in the vector 'fix') can be integers or strings
#	(e.g., c(2:4, "Effect1", 6, "Effect2") )
# v0.52, May 2011
# - Correction: If grouping was TRUE and a specified fixed main effect of a
#     factor was not present in any interaction, the function failed
# v0.51, May 2011:
# - parameter 'grouping' also works if keep = FALSE, if grouping is TRUE,
#	the effect and all adssociated ones of higher order are chosen to be
#	removed
# v0.5, May 2011:
# - new boolean parameter: 'grouping'; if both keep and grouping are TRUE,
#	the effects in fix and all subeffects are chosen to be kept
#	Note: In the present version, if keep is FALSE, grouping will be ignored
# v0.4a, May 2011:
# - if keep is TRUE, the to be kept effects are not removed from the
#	dependent variable but are actually added to the residuals
# - more efficient processing and less operations (if keep is set properly)
# v0.4, April 2011:
# - new parameter 'keep' allows the remove the effects not specified
# - more efficient processing
# v0.32, April 2011:
# - Correction: If random effects of random factors with order numbers < 1
#				were specified, the output was not correct.
# v0.3a, April 2011:
# changes to last version (v0.3):
# - more efficient processing
# v0.3, April 2011:
# changes to last version (v0.2):
# - now it is possible to remove all random effects (even random slopes)
# - the parameter 'ran' must be a list of vectors
# - switched order position of parameters 'fix' and 'ran'
# v0.2, February 2011:
# changes to last version (v0.1):
# - Correction: If just one fixed effect was specified, the function failed.
#				Now it is possible to specify a single number as parameter 'fix'


## INPUT:
# model:	an object of class 'mer' (lme4 packge), 'lmerMod' (lme4Eigen package)
# ran:		list of vectors of natural numbers according to random effects of the model;
#			the maximum length of this list is the number of random factors;
#			each list member includes the numbers of the random effects (of the current random factor)
#			(e.g., list(1:2, NULL, c(1, 3)) )
#			default value: NULL (no random-factor related variance is removed)
# fix:		vector of natural numbers or strings according to fixed effects of the model
#			(e.g., c(2:4, 6, 8:10), c("Effect1", "Effect2"), or c(2:4, "Effect1", 6, "Effect2"))
#			Vectors can consist of both integers and strings (R will transform all intergers to
#			strings if at least one string is entered);
#			redundant values will be ignored (one effect can't be removed more than once)
#			default value: NULL (no fixed effects are removed)
# keep:		logical value; if TRUE, the specified effects are not removed but kept
#			(and all other effects are removed)
# grouping:	logical value; if FALSE the specified effects in fix are used;
#			if TRUE, effects are grouped:
#				- if keep=TRUE, the specified effect (and all effects associated with the
#					variables) as well as all effects of lower order consisting solitary of
#					a subset of the variables of the specified effet are kept
#					(e.g., if the interaction A:B:C is specified, the following effects are
#					chosen:	A:B:C, A:B, A:C, B:C, A, B, and C)
#				- if keep=FALSE, the specified effect (and all effects associated with the
#					variables) as well as all effects of higher order consisting of
#					all variables of the specified effet (and other variables) are removed
#					(e.g., if the interaction A:B:C is specified, the following effects are
#					chosen:	A:B:C and A:B:C:x)
# family: a family object including a link function; 
#         either "identity" (default) or "logit" link function; this must be the
#         link function which was used for generating the model;
#       - gaussian(link = "identity") is the right option for most purposes, e.g. Gaussian
#         distributions; the dependent variable is not transformed
#       - binomial(link = "logit") is used for binomial dependent variables; the output vector
#         will contain probabilities which can be rounded to obtain data in the
#         original metric (zeroes and ones); note that even if keep=FALSE, the
#         base for the calculation are not the input values but the residuals

## OUTPUT:	a numerical vector

## How does it work?
# Random factor variance and fixed effects are removed from the dependent variable of an LMM analysis.
# The order of effects in the fixed-effects input vector is the same as in the model output.
# The returned vector includes the dependent variable corrected by the specified effects.
# Note. The currect version of this function works for the "identity" and "logit" model link functions
# only.
