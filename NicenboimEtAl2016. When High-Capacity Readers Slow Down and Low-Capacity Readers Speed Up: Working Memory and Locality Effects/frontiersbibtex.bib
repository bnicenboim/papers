  abstract = {With the arrival of the R packages nlme and lme4, linear mixed models (LMMs) have come to be widely used in experimentally-driven areas like psychology, linguistics, and cognitive science. This tutorial provides a practical introduction to fitting LMMs in a Bayesian framework using the probabilistic programming language Stan. We choose Stan (rather than WinBUGS or JAGS) because it provides an elegant and scalable framework for fitting models in most of the standard applications of LMMs. We ease the reader into fitting increasingly complex LMMs, first using a two-condition repeated measures self-paced reading study, followed by a more complex $2\times 2$ repeated measures factorial design that can be generalized to much more complex designs.}

  abstract =      {We present a detailed process theory of the
                   moment-by-moment working-memory retrievals and
                   associated control structure that subserve sentence
                   comprehension. The theory is derived from the
                   application of independently motivated principles of
                   memory and cognitive skill to the specialized task of
                   sentence parsing. The resulting theory construes
                   sentence processing as a series of skilled
                   associative memory retrievals modulated by
                   similarity-based interference and fluctuating
                   activation. The cognitive principles are formalized
                   in computational form in the Adaptive Control of
                   Thought-Rational (ACT-R) architecture, and our
                   process model is realized in ACT-R. We present the
                   results of 6 sets of simulations: 5 simulation sets
                   provide quantitative accounts of the effects of
                   length and structural interference on both
                   unambiguous and garden-path structures. A final
                   simulation set provides a graded taxonomy of double
                   center embeddings ranging from relatively easy to
                   extremely difficult. The explanation of
                   center-embedding difficulty is a novel one that
                   derives from the model' complete reliance on
                   discriminating retrieval cues in the absence of an
                   explicit representation of serial order information.
                   All fits were obtained with only 1 free scaling
                   parameter fixed across the simulations; all other
                   parameters were ACT-R defaults. The modeling results
                   support the hypothesis that fluctuating activation
                   and similarity-based interference are the key factors
                   shaping working memory in sentence processing. We
                   contrast the theory and empirical predictions with
                   several related accounts of sentence-processing

                   theory (DLT) and surprisal, against the Dundee
                   Corpus, which contains the eye-tracking record of 10
                   participants reading 51,000 words of newspaper text.
                   Our results show that DLT integration cost is not a
                   significant predictor of reading times for arbitrary
                   words in the corpus. However, DLT successfully
                   predicts reading times for nouns. We also find
                   evidence for integration cost effects at auxiliaries,
                   not predicted by DLT. For surprisal, we demonstrate
                   that an unlexicalized formulation of surprisal can
                   predict reading times for arbitrary words in the
                   corpus. Comparing DLT integration cost and surprisal,
                   we find that the two measures are uncorrelated, which
                   suggests that a complete theory will need to
                   incorporate both aspects of processing complexity. We
                   conclude that eye-tracking corpora, which provide
                   reading time data for naturally occurring,
                   contextualized sentences, can complement experimental
                   evidence as a basis for theories of processing

                   capacity available for language comprehension
                   processes. Reading the verbs of an object relative
                   sentence, such as The reporter that the senator

                   language, and their resulting comprehension is less
                   accurate. Experiment 1 investigated the effects of a
                   concurrent working memory load and found that with no
                   load or a small memory load many Low Span readers

                   variation in comprehension ability is predicted by
                   measures of working memory capacity (WMC). The
                   primary goal of this study was to investigate the
                   mediating role of mind-wandering experiences in the
                   association between WMC and normal individual
                   differences in reading comprehension, as predicted by
                   the executive-attention theory of WMC (e.g., Engle \&
                   Kane, 2004). We used a latent-variable,
                   structural-equation-model approach, testing skilled
                   adult readers on 3 WMC span tasks, 7 varied
                   reading-comprehension tasks, and 3 attention-control
                   tasks. Mind wandering was assessed using
                   experimenter-scheduled thought probes during 4
                   different tasks (2 reading, 2 attention-control). The
                   results support the executive-attention theory of
                   WMC. Mind wandering across the 4 tasks loaded onto a
                   single latent factor, reflecting a stable individual
                   difference. Most important, mind wandering was a
                   significant mediator in the relationship between WMC
                   and reading comprehension, suggesting that the
                   WMCcomprehension correlation is driven, in part,
                   by attention control over intruding thoughts. We
                   discuss implications for theories of WMC, attention
                   control, and reading comprehension.},

                   contexts can facilitate lexical processing, and
                   connects these findings to well-known models of
                   parallel constraint-based comprehension. In addition,
                   the theory leads to a number of specific predictions
                   about the role of expectation in syntactic
                   comprehension, including the reversal of
                   locality-based difficulty patterns in syntactically
                   constrained contexts, and conditions under which
                   increased ambiguity facilitates processing. The paper
                   examines a range of established results bearing on
                   these predictions, and shows that they are largely
                   consistent with the surprisal theory.},

ABSTRACT={There is a wealth of evidence showing that increasing the distance between an argument and its head leads to more processing effort, namely, locality effects; these are usually associated with constraints in working memory (DLT: Gibson, 2000; activation-based model: Lewis and Vasishth, 2005). In SOV languages, however, the opposite effect  has been found: antilocality (see discussion in Levy et al., 2013). Antilocality effects can be explained by the expectation-based approach as proposed by Levy (2008) or by the activation-based model of sentence processing   as proposed by Lewis and Vasishth (2005).
We report an eye-tracking and a self-paced reading study with sentences in Spanish  together with measures of individual differences to examine the distinction between expectation- and memory-based accounts, and  within memory-based accounts the further distinction between DLT and the activation-based model. The experiments show that (i) antilocality effects as predicted by the expectation account appear only for high-capacity readers; (ii) increasing dependency length by interposing material that modifies the head of the dependency (the verb) produces stronger facilitation than increasing dependency length with material that does not modify the head; this is in  agreement with the activation-based model but not with the expectation account; and (iii) a possible outcome of memory load on low-capacity readers is the increase in regressive saccades (locality effects as predicted by memory-based accounts) or, surprisingly, a speedup in the self-paced reading task; the latter consistent with good-enough parsing (Ferreira et al., 2002). In sum, the study suggests that individual differences in working memory capacity play a role in dependency resolution, and that some of the aspects of dependency resolution  can be best explained with the activation-based model together with a prediction component.}}

  abstract =      {It is well known that sentences containing
                   object-extracted relative clauses (e.g., The reporter
                   that the senator attacked admitted the error) are
                   more difficult to comprehend than sentences
                   containing subject-extracted relative clauses (e.g.,
                   The reporter that attacked the senator admitted the
                   error). Two major accounts of this phenomenon make
                   different predictions about where, in the course of
                   incremental processing of an object relative,
                   difficulty should first appear. An account
                   emphasizing memory processes (Gibson, 1998; Grodner
                   \& Gibson, 2005) predicts difficulty at the relative
                   clause verb, while an account emphasizing
                   experience-based expectations (Hale, 2001; Levy,
                   2008) predicts earlier difficulty, at the relative
                   clause subject. Two eye movement experiments tested
                   these predictions. Regressive saccades were much more
                   likely from the subject noun phrase of an object
                   relative than from the same noun phrase occurring
                   within a subject relative (Experiment 1) or within a
                   verbal complement clause (Experiment 2). This effect
                   was further amplified when the relative pronoun that
                   was omitted. However, reading time was also inflated
                   on the object relative clause verb in both
                   experiments. These results suggest that the violation
                   of expectations and the difficulty of memory
                   retrieval both contribute to the difficulty of object
                   relative clauses, but that these two sources of
                   difficulty have qualitatively distinct behavioral
                   consequences in normal reading.},

                   and D.Caplan's (1996) critique of this approach

                   versions of the RAN. Here a slightly modified
                   computerized version of the RAN was created and the
                   equivalency between the computerized RAN and the
                   conventional version was investigated using a
                   university student sample. Naming times on the
                   conventional and computerized RAN were highly
                   correlated, overall, and for each of the four RAN
                   stimulus types (letters, digit, colors, objects).
                   Conventional and computerized RAN times predicted
                   reading rate and reading comprehension scores equally
                   well and both showed very high test-retest
                   reliability. With our university student sample,
                   findings indicate equivalency between the two testing
                   mediums in all areas examined.},

                   rapidly naming sequences of items presented in a
                   visual array. RAN has generated considerable interest
                   because RAN performance predicts reading achievement.
                   This study sought to determine what elements of RAN
                   are responsible for the shared variance between RAN
                   and reading performance using a series of cognitive
                   tasks and a latent variable modelling approach.
                   Participants performed RAN measures, a test of
                   reading speed and comprehension, and six tasks, which
                   tapped various hypothesised components of the RAN.
                   RAN shared 10\% of the variance with reading
                   comprehension and 17\% with reading rate. Together,
                   the decomposition tasks explained 52\% and 39\% of
                   the variance shared between RAN and reading
                   comprehension and between RAN and reading rate,
                   respectively. Significant predictors suggested that
                   working memory encoding underlies part of the

                   Seventy-one non-college-bound 16-24 year-old speakers
                   of English completed a battery of 18 verbal and
                   cognitive skill assessments, and read a series of
                   sentences as their eye-movements were monitored.
                   Statistical analyses were performed to establish what
                   tests of reading abilities were predictive of
                   eye-movement patterns across this population and how
                   strong the effects were. We found that individual
                   scores in rapid automatized naming and word

                   variables with reliable predictivity throughout the

                   strongly modulated the influence of word length and

                   processing has recently begun to receive attention,
                   however whether these effects arise during encoding
                   or retrieval remains unclear. This paper draws on
                   basic memory research to help distinguish these
                   explanations and reports data from an experiment that
                   manipulates the possibility for retrieval
                   interference while holding encoding conditions
                   constant. We found clear support for the principle of
                   cue-overload, wherein cues available at retrieval
                   cannot uniquely distinguish among competitors, thus
                   giving rise to interference effects. We discuss the
                   data in relation to a cue-based parsing framework
                   (Van Dyke \{\&\} Lewis, 2003) and other interference
                   effects observed in sentence processing (e.g.,
                   Gordon, Hendrick, \{\&\} Johnson, 2001, 2004). We
                   conclude from the available data that the memory
                   system that subserves language comprehension operates
                   according to similar principles as memory in other
                   domains.},

                   working-memory capacity of a comprehender can
                   constrain syntactic parsing and thereby affect the
                   processing of syntactic ambiguities. The model's
                   predictions are examined in four experiments that
                   measure the reading times for two constructions that
                   contain a temporary syntactic ambiguity. An example
                   of the syntactic ambiguity is The soldiers warned
                   about the dangers . . . ; the verb warned may either
                   be the main verb, in which case soldiers is the
                   agent; or the verb warned may introduce a relative
                   clause, in which case soldiers is the patient of
                   warned rather than the agent, as in The soldiers
                   warned about the dangers conducted the midnight raid.
                   The model proposes that both alternative
                   interpretations of warned are initially activated.
                   However, the duration for which both interpretations
                   are maintained depends, in part, on the reader's
                   working-memory capacity, which can be assessed by the
                   Reading Span task (Daneman \& Carpenter, 1980). The
                   word-by-word reading times indicate that all subjects
                   do additional processing after encountering an
                   ambiguity, suggesting that they generate both
                   representations. Furthermore, readers with larger
                   working-memory capacities maintain both
                   representations for some period of time (several
                   words), whereas readers with smaller working-memory
                   capacities revert to maintaining only the more likely
                   representation.},

ABSTRACT={In explicit memory recall and recognition tasks, elaboration and contextual isolation both facilitate memory performance. Here, we investigate these effects in the context of sentence processing:  targets for retrieval during online sentence processing of English object relative clause constructions differ in the amount of elaboration associated with the target noun phrase, or the homogeneity of superficial features (text color).   Experiment 1 shows that greater elaboration for targets during the encoding phase reduces reading times at retrieval sites, but elaboration of non-targets has considerably weaker effects. Experiment 2 illustrates that processing isolated superficial features of target noun phrases --- here, a green word in a sentence with words colored white --- does not lead to enhanced memory performance, despite triggering longer encoding times. These results are interpreted in the light of the memory models of Nairne 1990, 2001, 2006, which state that encoding remnants contribute to the set of retrieval cues that provide the basis for similarity-based interference effects.}}

  Abstract                 = {Adaptive control of thought-rational (ACT-R; J. R. Anderson \& C. Lebiere, 1998) has evolved into a theory that consists of multiple modules but also explains how these modules are integrated to produce coherent cognition. The perceptual-motor modules, the goal module, and the declarative memory module are presented as examples of specialized systems in ACT-R. These modules are associated with distinct cortical regions. These modules place chunks in buffers where they can be detected by a production system that responds to patterns of information in the buffers. At any point in time, a single production rule is selected to respond to the current pattern. Subsymbolic processes serve to guide the selection of rules to fire as well as the internal operations of some modules. Much of learning involves tuning of these subsymbolic processes. A number of simple and complex empirical examples are described to illustrate how these modules function singly and in concert.},
  Annote                   = {* modules: 1. a visual module for identifying objects in the visual field, 2. manual module for controlling the hands, a declarative 3. module for retrieving information from memory, and a 4. goal module for keeping track of current goals and intentions Coordination in the behavior of these modules is achieved through a central production system. This central production system is not sensitive to most of the activity of these modules but rather can only respond to a limited amount of information that is deposited in the buffers of these modules. -the information in these modules is largely encapsulated, and the modules communicate only through the information they make available in their buffers. - The buffers of these modules hold the limited information that the production system can respond to. They * The core produc- tion system can recognize patterns in these buffers and make changes to these buffers, * production rules represent ACTR’s procedural memory An important function of the production rules is to update the buffers in the ACTR architecture. * Thus, the critical cycle in ACTR is one in which the buffers hold repre- sentations determined by the external world and internal modules, patterns in these buffers are recognized, a production fires, and the buffers are then updated for another cycle. (The assumption in ACTR is that this cycle takes about 50 ms to complete) * The conditions of the production rule specify a pattern of activity in the buffers that the rule will match, and the action specifies changes to be made to buffers. * mixture of parallel and serial processing: -Within each module, there is a great deal of parallelism Also, the processes within different modules can go on in parallel and asynchronously. However, there are also two levels of serial bottlenecks in the system. i), the content of any buffer is limited to a single declarative unit of knowledge, called a chunk in ACTR. Thus, only a single memory can be retrieved at a time or only a single object can be encoded from the visual field. ii) only a single production is selected at each cycle to fire The ACTR visual system: i) A visual-location module and buffer represent the dorsal where system ii) a visual-object module and buffer represent the ventral what system. When a production makes a request of the where system: the production specifies a series of constraints, and the where system returns a chunk representing a location meeting those constraints. Constraints are attributevalue pairs that can restrict the search based on visual properties of the object (such as “color: red”).Through the where system, ACTR has knowledge of where allthe objects are. to identify an object, it must make a request of the what system: A request will cause the what system to shift visual attention to that location, process the object located there, and generate a declarative memory chunk represent- ing the object. Modules: * Goal Module cognitive core of ACTR: * The declarative memory system * the procedural system , the activation of achunk is a sum of a base-level activation, reflecting its general usefulness in the past, and an associative activation, reflecting its relevance to the current context.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding a sentence requires a working memory of the partial products of comprehension, so that linguistic relations between temporally distal parts of the sentence can be rapidly computed. We describe an emerging theoretical framework for this working memory system that incorporates several independently motivated principles of memory: a sharply limited attentional focus, rapid retrieval of item (but not order) information subject to interference from similar items, and activation decay (forgetting over time). A computational model embodying these principles provides an explanation of the functional capacities and severe limitations of human processing, as well as accounts of reading times. The broad implication is that the detailed nature of cross-linguistic sentence processing emerges from the interaction of general principles of human memory with the specialized task of language comprehension.},

For example, in sentences with long-distance dependencies such as (1), the noun phrase (NP) ‘a toy’ must be maintained in memory until it is interpreted as the object of ‘like’:(1) This weekend we bought a toy that Amparo really hoped Melissa would like. In general, establishing any kind of linguistic relationship requires some memory of the immediate past. This functional requirement gives rise to the following theore- tical question:what are the working memory processes that bring prior linguistic material into contact with present material, and what are the constraints on those processes? nature of retrieval from verbal working memory: *Limited focus of attention (McElree, B. (2006) Accessing recent events. In) *Fast, parallel associative retrieval of item information: fast retrieval that involves a parallel match of cues against all items in memory. McElree, B. (2006) *Slow, serial access to serial order information SAT paradigms also provide compelling evidence against fast parallel access of serial order information. McElree, B. (2006) The basic idea is that each incoming word triggers retrievals to integrate that word with the preceding structure. Retrieval is accom- plished by a simple type of associative access: content- based retrieval, where the retrieval cues are a subset of the features of the item to be retrieved So what are the retrieval cues? However, the model does not claim that words trigger the retrievals of other words via lexical associa- tions. What is being retrieved are partial representations of linguistic constituents, not words (represented as fea- ture bundles, or ‘chunks’ [16,28]), and the cues that drive the retrieval are not simply features of the lexical item but are grammatically derived from the current word and context. And what's retrieved exactly? Dependency Locality Theory [2], distance is quantified by the number of new discourse referents that intervene between a head (e.g. a verb) and its dependents (its arguments); this calculation includes verbal elements and the dependent itself. The bottom line is that expected locality effects do not always arise: a comprehensive theory must account for the highly circumscribed contexts in which they do arise and also their complete reversal in some cases. The broader implication is that it might not be necessary to make assumptions about the appropriate linguistic metric of distance  the fundamental metric instead might be time.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a study of the effect of working memory load on the interpretation of pronouns in different discourse contexts: stories with and without a topic shift. We discuss a computational model (in ACT-R, Anderson, 2007) to explain how referring expressions are acquired and used. On the basis of simulations of this model, it is predicted that WM constraints only affect adults' pronoun resolution in stories with a topic shift, but not in stories without a topic shift. This latter prediction was tested in an experiment. The results of this experiment confirm that WM load reduces adults' sensitivity to discourse cues signaling a topic shift, thus influencing their interpretation of subsequent pronouns.},
  Annote                   = {As the amount of spreading activation deter- mines the ability to maintain goal-relevant information, differences in spreading activa- tion account for individual differences in working memory capacity (Daily, Lovett, \& Reder, 2001). if the subject spreads a small amount of activation, reflecting a low WM capacity, then there will be no effect on the discourse elements associated with the subject. In that case, the effects of frequency and recency will be the main determinants of referent retrieval.},

  Abstract                 = {<p>Expectation-driven facilitation (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008) and locality-driven retrieval difficulty (Gibson, 1998, 2000; Lewis &amp; Vasishth, 2005) are widely recognized to be two critical factors in incremental sentence processing; there is accumulating evidence that both can influence processing difficulty. However, it is unclear whether and how expectations and memory interact. We first confirm a key prediction of the expectation account: a Hindi self-paced reading study shows that when an expectation for an upcoming part of speech is dashed, building a rarer structure consumes more processing time than building a less rare structure. This is a strong validation of the expectation-based account. In a second study, we show that when expectation is strong, i.e., when a particular verb is predicted, strong facilitation effects are seen when the appearance of the verb is delayed; however, when expectation is weak, i.e., when only the part of speech âverbâ is predicted but a particular verb is not predicted, the facilitation disappears and a tendency towards a locality effect is seen. The interaction seen between expectation strength and distance shows that strong expectations cancel locality effects, and that weak expectations allow locality effects to emerge.</p>},

  Abstract                 = {Studies examining individual differences in working memory capacity have suggested that individuals with low working memory capacities demonstrate impaired performance on a variety of attention and memory tasks compared with individuals with high working memory capacities. This working memory limitation can be conceived of as arising from 2 components: a dynamic attention component (primary memory) and a probabilistic cue-dependent search component (secondary memory). This framework is used to examine previous individual differences studies of working memory capacity, and new evidence is examined on the basis of predictions of the framework to performance on immediate free recall. It is suggested that individual differences in working memory capacity are partially due to the ability to maintain information accessible in primary memory and the ability to search for information from secondary memory.},

  Abstract                 = {Fluent reading depends on a complex set of cognitive processes that must work together in perfect concert. Rapid automatized naming (RAN) tasks provide insight into this system, acting as a microcosm of the processes involved in reading. In this review, we examine both RAN and reading fluency and how each has shaped our understanding of reading disabilities. We explore the research that led to our current understanding of the relationships between RAN and reading and what makes RAN unique as a cognitive measure. We explore how the automaticity that supports RAN affects reading across development, reading abilities, and languages, and the biological bases of these processes. Finally, we bring these converging areas of knowledge together by examining what the collective studies of RAN and reading fluency contribute to our goals of creating optimal assessments and interventions that help every child become a fluent, comprehending reader.},

  Abstract                 = {The role of interference as a primary determinant of forgetting in memory has long been accepted, however its role as a contributor to poor comprehension is just beginning to be understood. The current paper reports two studies, in which speed-accuracy tradeoff and eye-tracking methodologies were used with the same materials to provide converging evidence for the role of syntactic and semantic cues as mediators of both proactive (PI) and retroactive interference (RI) during comprehension. Consistent with previous work (e.g., Van Dyke \& Lewis, 2003), we found that syntactic constraints at the retrieval site are among the cues that drive retrieval in comprehension, and that these constraints effectively limit interference from potential distractors with semantic/pragmatic properties in common with the target constituent. The data are discussed in terms of a cue-overload account, in which interference both arises from and is mediated through a direct-access retrieval mechanism that utilizes a linear, weighted cue-combinatoric scheme.},
